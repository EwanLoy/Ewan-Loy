## Task 1: Introduction
This room intoduces the UKC (Unified Kill Chain) framework that is used to help understand how cyber attacks occur

**Learning Objectives**
  - Understanding why frameworks such as the UKC are important and helpful in establishing a good cybersecurity posture
  - Using the UKC to understand an attacker's motivation, methodologies and tactics
  - Understanding the various phases of the UKC
  - Discover that the UKC is a framework that is used to complement other frameworks such as MITRE.

---

## Task 2: What is a "Kill Chain"
A Kill chain is a military term used to explain the various stages of an attack. In cybersecurity it is used to describe the methodology/path attackers use to approach a target
  - An attacker scanning, exploiting a web vulnerability, and escalating privileges will be a kill chain
  - Objective is to understand an attackers kill chain so that defensive measures can be put in place to protect a system or disrupt an attack

## Task 3: What is "Threat Modelling"
A series of steps to ultimately improve the security of a system. Threat modelling is about identifying risks and boils down to:
  - **Identifying Assets:** Systems and applications that need to be secured andwhat function they serve
  - **Assess Vulnerabilities:** Assess the weaknesses these systems may have and how they could be exploited
  - **Plan of Action:** To secure these systes and applications
  - **Prevention:** Policies to prevent these vulnerabilities from occuring again

Threat modelling is an important procedure in reducing risk within a system or application, as it creates a high-level overview of an organisation's IT assets and the procedures to resolve vulnerabilities

UKC framework helps identify potential attack surfaces and how these systems may be exploited

Common frameworks used in threat modelling:
 - STRIDE
 - DREAD
 - CVSS

## Task 4: Introducing the Unified Kill Chain
- The Unified Kill Chain was introduced in 2017, it is a modern and detailed framework designed to compliment other frameworks, such as Cyber Kill Chain and Mitre's ATT&CK.
- The UKC breaks down an attack into 18 detailed phases
**Benifits of the Unified Kill Chain**
  - Modern (Released in 2017, updated in 2022)
  - Extremely detailed (18 phases)
  - Covers an antire attack and includes identifying an attacker's intent
  - Highlights a much more realistic attack scenario; various stages will re-occur
