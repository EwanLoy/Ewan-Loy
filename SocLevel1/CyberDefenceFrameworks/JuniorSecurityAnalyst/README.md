## Task 2: Security Operations Center (SOC)
The core function of a SOC is to investigate, monitor, prevent, and respond to threats in the cyber realm 24/7. The number of people working in a SOC varies depending on the size of the organisation

  - SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
  - Reporting

**Preparation and Prevention**
  - As a junior analyst, you should stay informed of current cyber threats, using resources such as twitter and feedly can help. It's crucial to detect and and hunt threats, work on a       security roadmap, and be ready for the worst case scenario
  - Prevention methods include gathering intelligence on the latest threats, threat actors and their TTP's (Tactics, techniques, and procedures). It also includes the maintenacne of things like firewall signatures, patching vulnerabilities, block/safe-listing applications, email adddresses, and IP's.

## Task 3: A Day in the Life of a Junior SOC Analyst
This task simulated a real-world scenario in which I acted as a junior SOC analyst to investigate suspicious activity, and respond accordingly.

The goal was to use a security monitoring platform to:
  - Identify a malicious IP address
  - Investigate the associated alert
  - Determine who to escalate the alert to
  - Take action to block the threat
