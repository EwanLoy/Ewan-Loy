## Task 1: Introduction
  - The Cyber Kill Chain is a framework developed by Lockheed Martin in 2011 based on the military concept. The framework defines the steps an adversary must take in order to succeed
  - Understanding the Kill Chain helps you to recognise the intrusion attempts and understand the intruder's goals and objectives
**7 Phases of the Cyber Kill Chain**
    - Reconnaissance
    - Weaponization
    - Delivery
    - Exploitation
    - Installation
    - Command & Control
    - Actions on Objectives
**Learning Objectives:** Learn each phase of the Cyber Kill Chain Framework, the advantages and disadvantages of the traditional cyber kill chain

## Task 2: Reconnaissance
Summary of how attackers gather information about targets using OSINT, scanning, or social engineering.

---

## Task 3: Weaponization
Description of how attackers pair exploit code with delivery mechanisms to craft payloads.

---

## Task 4: Delivery
Methods used to deliver the payload, such as phishing emails, USBs, or drive-by downloads.

---

## Task 5: Exploitation
How the payload is executed on the target, often exploiting a vulnerability or tricking the user.

---

## Task 6: Installation
Overview of how malware persists on the system through registry changes, scheduled tasks, or implants.

---

## Task 7: Command & Control
Techniques used by attackers to establish a communication channel with the compromised system.

---

## Task 8: Actions on Objectives (Exfiltration)
What the attacker does post-access: data theft, privilege escalation, lateral movement, or destruction.

---

## Task 9: Practice Analysis
Brief reflection on the hands-on exercise and how it reinforced understanding of each kill chain phase.

---

## Task 10: Conclusion
Final thoughts on the importance of detecting attacks early in the chain and breaking the adversaryâ€™s workflow.
