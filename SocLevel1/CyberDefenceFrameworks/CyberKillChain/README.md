## Task 1: Introduction
  - The Cyber Kill Chain is a framework developed by Lockheed Martin in 2011 based on the military concept. The framework defines the steps an adversary must take in order to succeed
  - Understanding the Kill Chain helps you to recognise the intrusion attempts and understand the intruder's goals and objectives
**7 Phases of the Cyber Kill Chain**
    - Reconnaissance
    - Weaponization
    - Delivery
    - Exploitation
    - Installation
    - Command & Control
    - Actions on Objectives
**Learning Objectives:** Learn each phase of the Cyber Kill Chain Framework, the advantages and disadvantages of the traditional cyber kill chain

## Task 2: Reconnaissance
Reconnaisance is discovering and collecting information on the system and the victim. This is the planning phase for adversaries and often involves the use of OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) techniques

**What attackers do in this phase**
  - Collect information on an organisation or individuals from publicly available sources
  - Study employee names, email addresses, technologies in use, and infrastructure layout
  - Use tools to perform email harvesting, subdomain discovery, and metadata collection
**Common tools**
  - **theHarvester** for gathering emails, domains, IPs, and subdomains
  - **Hunter.io** for email lookup and domain level intelligence
  - **OSINT Framework** a collection of categorised tools for data discovery
  - **Social Media** such as LinkedIn and Facebook to gather information used in a phishing attack

## Task 3: Weaponization
Description of how attackers pair exploit code with delivery mechanisms to craft payloads.

---

## Task 4: Delivery
Methods used to deliver the payload, such as phishing emails, USBs, or drive-by downloads.

---

## Task 5: Exploitation
How the payload is executed on the target, often exploiting a vulnerability or tricking the user.

---

## Task 6: Installation
Overview of how malware persists on the system through registry changes, scheduled tasks, or implants.

---

## Task 7: Command & Control
Techniques used by attackers to establish a communication channel with the compromised system.

---

## Task 8: Actions on Objectives (Exfiltration)
What the attacker does post-access: data theft, privilege escalation, lateral movement, or destruction.

---

## Task 9: Practice Analysis
Brief reflection on the hands-on exercise and how it reinforced understanding of each kill chain phase.

---

## Task 10: Conclusion
Final thoughts on the importance of detecting attacks early in the chain and breaking the adversaryâ€™s workflow.
