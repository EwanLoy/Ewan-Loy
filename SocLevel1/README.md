# TryHackMe SOC Level 1 Path

This repository documents my personal learning journey through the [SOC Level 1 Path](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/soclevel1) on **TryHackMe**.

The aim of this repository is not to create step-by-step walkthroughs, but to track my own progress and help me:
  - Reflect on what I've learned
  - Reinforce key concepts
  - Build a reference I can return to and expand as I continue to learn
