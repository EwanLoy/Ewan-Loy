# Basic Home Lab Build
In order to practice basic log analysis and simulating real world attacks I built a home SOC lab following a tutorial from 'My DFIR' on youtube. The lab will help me practice using tools and techniques being learned thrpugh the TryHackMe SOC level 1 course I am also completing. This repository will document the process of setting up the lab and beginning to perform attacks and learn to use tools such as Sysmon and Splunk.
