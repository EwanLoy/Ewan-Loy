# Basic Home Lab Build
In order to practice basic log analysis and simulating real world attacks I built a home SOC lab following a tutorial from 'My DFIR' on youtube. The lab will help me practice using tools and techniques being learned thrpugh the TryHackMe SOC level 1 course I am also completing.
